      ", and I just shipped my first research contribution 🚀\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been diving deep into how AI agents execute actions. The current state-of-the-art choices are:\n",
      "→ JSON agents (reliable but too rigid)\n",
      "→ CodeAgents (flexible, but parsing errors kill performance)\n",
      "\n",
      "But what if I told you I found a third option that beats both? 👇\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem I discovered: 🤕\n",
      "\n",
      "After analyzing 15,724 agent traces across GAIA, MATH, Frames & SimpleQA, I found that parsing errors in the first action reduce success rates by 21.3%. That’s a lot!\n",
      "\n",
      "JSON agents avoid this but lack support for loops and state, which are usually required in real-world use cases. CodeAgents are expressive but fragile when extracting Python from markdown.\n",
      "\n",
      "My approach: Structured CodeAgents 👷🧠\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of generating code in markdown blocks, what if agents generated both thoughts AND code in a structured JSON format?\n",
      "\n",
      "The results were surprising:\n",
      "Parsing errors went to 0, and performance doubled compared to JSON agents. Structured generation consistently wins for capable models. 📈\n",
      "\n",
      "Claude-4-Sonnet: 32% → 65% → 68% (JSON → Code → Structured)\n",
      "GPT-4o: 34% → 53% → 54%\n",
      "Qwen-235B: 45% → 48% → 56%\n",
      "\n",
      "But there’s a bit of a catch ⚠️:\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a \"structure tax.\" Smaller models completely fail when forced to handle JSON formatting + Python syntax + reasoning simultaneously. The cognitive overhead is too much. The Python generated in JSON tags usually has syntax errors and breaks down the agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "What this means for agent builders:\n",
      "Choose your architecture based on your model's capability. For frontier models, structured generation is a win. For smaller models, stick with simpler approaches.\n",
